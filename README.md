# LookInnaBookStoreSimulation

This application has two components, a server and a client side.



The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

The server by default runs on PORT:3000 while the client side application runs on PORT:3001.

The server must run on PORT:3000 for the client side app to work.

# To start server

Go into the server folder and do
`npm install`
`npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

# To start client
Go into the App folder and install all dependcies first.
`cd App`
`npm install`
`cd src`
Go into the src folder and do
`npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in the browser.

**Note:The client would not work without the server running first.**
