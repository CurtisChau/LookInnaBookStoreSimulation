This application has two components, a server and a client side.

The server by default runs on PORT:3000 while the client side application runs on PORT:3001.

The server must run on PORT:3000 for the client side app to work.

To start server

Go into the server folder and do
npm install
npm start

To start client
Go into the src folder and do
npm install
npm start

Note:The client would not work without the server running first.
